# kustomization-auto-deployer
Automatically deploy **all** commits to a Flux [`GitRepository`](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/gitrepositories/).

## Description
This controller provides a CRD that allows a user to configure the automated deployment of every commit made to a git repository using a Flux [`Kustomization`](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/kustomize/kustomization/).

Normally, the `GitRepository` polls the `HEAD` of the configured repository with the configured `Interval` and then `Kustomization` are notified of the new commit available and update.

The `GitRepository` will send a [notification](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/notifications/) indicating that it has been updated to the `HEAD` commit ID.

If there are multiple commits within the timeframe of the `Interval` when the `GitRepository` polls the repository, it will get all the commits.

The `Kustomization` will send a notification indicating that it has (successfully) deployed the `HEAD` commit ID.

The `Kustomization` doesn't deploy the interim commits separately, there's no way to report that these have been deployed, yes, they are included in the `HEAD` but there's no way to notify on the success or failure of a deployment of an intermediary commit because it's not deployed in a way that we can determine whether or not it would be successful.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/kustomization-auto-deployer:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/kustomization-auto-deployer:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
